# Majiang-Implementation
A Java implementation of the turn-based traditional Chinese card (`tile`) game Majiang (aka. Mahjong).


## Features
* Turn-based: assign human or auto-play mode for each player, `game` class acts as a "host" responsible for communications between players
* Multi-styled: one `Game` object can host different styled game by calling different Initialisers at runtime
* Safe human inputs: checks format errors to ensure programme does not crash due to incorrect human inputs when playing tiles

## Intentions
* Familiarise myself with Java language and OOP principles
* Practise using common design patterns as part of a real project
* Have fun with programming

## Potentials
* Play-bots: develop algorithms to calculate the best action for each situation, potential use of AI or machine learning algorithms
* Graphics: design images for the game layout and explore graphics packages of Java
* More styles: the project should permit the addition of other styles by adding files and not changing existing ones
